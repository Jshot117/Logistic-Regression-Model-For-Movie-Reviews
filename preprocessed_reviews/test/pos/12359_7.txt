once upon a time ,  in sweden ,  there was a poor salvation army sister .  at death ' s door ,  she requests ,   " send for david holm !  "  but ,  victor sjöström  ( as david holm )  cannot be located ,  because he is spending new year ' s eve in a graveyard ,  with his drinking buddies .  dying sister astrid holm  ( as edit )  wants to see if praying for mr .  sjöström ' s soul ,  over the past year ,  has produced any results ;  arguably ,  it has not .  in the graveyard ,  sjöström tells the story of  " the phantom carriage "  ,  which he heard from his dead friend tore svennberg  ( as georges )  .  according to legend ,  the last person to die in each year must pick up the souls of all the dead people ,  until being relieved next new year ' s eve .  .  .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > director sjöström ,  whose lead performance is very strong ,  combines with photographer julius jaenzon to create a visually appealing film .  the great  " double exposure "  effect is used frequently ,  but never seems overdone ;  and ,  it doesn ' t make the film ' s other dramatic highlights any less memorable  ( for example ,  sjöström ' s tearing of his sewn coat and axing of the door )  .  a selma lagerlöf story probably wasn ' t one you could ,  or would want to ,  tamper with in the 1920s  -  which may ,  or may not be ,  why the ending of this film is a letdown .  and ,  unlike similar spiritual stories ,  it ' s difficult to suspend your disbelief ,  if you think too carefully about what is really happening in  " körkarlen "  .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  körkarlen  ( 1 / 1 / 21 )  victor sjöström  ~  victor sjöström ,  hilda borgström ,  tore svennberg
