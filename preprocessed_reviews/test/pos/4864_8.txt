i picked up a dvd at the 1 Â€  discount ,  having no idea what it ' s about  ( but at that price i can ' t resist .  .  )  in brief :  i was positively surprised .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > so much that i did quite some research .  on the german dvd  ( part 2 of a series of 3 )  ,  episodes were recombined into two 85 minute parts ,  and out of order .  here are my results ,  based on wikipedia ' s episode list :  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  " doomsday "  is in my boots  +  the voice  ( final episode )  .   < br  /  >  < br  /  >  " war of the machines "  is hel  &  high water  ( 1 ,  2 )   +  pod listener  +  juggernaut down .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > well ,  what can i say .  underdressed girlies are of course interesting for older men .  i never watched charlie ' s angels so much ,  so i can ' t compare ,  but the more i watched ,  the less i looked out for bikini tops and their fillings .  instead ,  the characters  ( both m and f )  became more interesting .  i can imagine feminists have their fun with this ,  too .  all in all ,  maybe a guilty pleasure ,  but a pleasure it was  :  ^  )
