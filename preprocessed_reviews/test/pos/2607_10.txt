during the war for southern independence ,  general spanky mobilizes his forces to defend the local women  &  children against a yankee invasion .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > in 1936 ,  hal roach decided it was time for his popular our gang kids to branch out into occasional feature - length films .  with the big success of shirley temple in two civil war period movies in 1935  ( the little colonel ,  the littlest rebel )  ,  it was only natural that roach would look in that same direction for his gang .  although given a rather lavish production and distributed by mgm ,  general spanky was not a critical or box - office success .  the little gangsters would henceforth stick to short subjects .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > although he ' s given top billing  &  the title role ,  george   spanky '  mcfarland is rivaled throughout the film ' s first half by little billie   buckwheat '  thomas .  here were two of the finest young actors to ever appear in american movies .  with all the experience of old ,  seasoned pros ,  these two gamin could steal scenes  &  hearts with equal bravado .  a constant joy ,  without a false note between them ,  they provide the essential reason for watching the film today .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > phillips holmes gives a quiet ,  gentlemanly performance as spanky ' s adult protector .  nearly forgotten now ,  holmes was a fine actor who died much too soon ,  during world war two .  genial ralph morgan is especially good as a sympathetic union general  -  his scenes with spanky are quite amusing .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > other our gangers appear midpoint into the movie ,  most notably carl   alfalfa '  switzer ;  he gets to warble   just before the battle ,  mother .  '  even pretty rosina lawrence  ( the gang ' s schoolmarm )  shows up to play holmes '  beloved .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > irving pichel is particularly slimy as a cowardly cardsharp turned vindictive yankee captain .  bumbling willie best  &  feisty louise beavers play miss lawrence ' s slaves .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > it should be noted that there is racism in the film ,  not unusual for hollywood of that era  -  but almost completely missing in the original series of our gang shorts .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > fans of 19th century music will enjoy paying attention to the soundtrack ,  which is a long succession of ancient tunes .
