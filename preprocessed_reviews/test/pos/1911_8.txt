a blaxploitation classic ,  this movie was terribly influential in rap music for the  " toasts "  that rudy ray moore performs .  toasts are long rhyming stories that are funny and deliver a point ,  and you can see how they would naturally evolve into rap .  for more on toasts ,  rudy ray moore ,  and why this movie is important ,  go to dolemite . com .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > which leaves us just to talk about the movie itself .  this movie packs in a great deal of  " laugh - at - the - funny - outfits - and - hairstyles "  bang for the buck ,  as nearly every shot has some sort of outrageous element or dialogue .  it starts as dolemite is being released from prison in order to find out who framed him and bring him to justice .  i was unaware that prisons release people so they can prove their own innocence ,  but that ' s me ,  i ' m a neophyte in the prison scene .  he is helped in this by queen bee ,  who is dolemite ' s lead prostitute and has been running his brothel while he ' s been gone .  she has also put all of his prostitutes through karate school ,  so now he has an army of female karate fighters .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > i watched this movie in two parts ,  which is usually a mistake ,  but in this case it provided an interesting contrast .  the first part i watched on my lunch break while exercising ,  and wasn ' t enjoying it much at all .  it struck me as particularly poorly made blaxploitation ,  with a ludicrous story ,  shoddy craftsmanship  well ,  i guess that makes it sound like it had some craftsmanship  and tons of outrageous locales ,  outfits and dialogue .  but i wasn ' t enjoying that  in fact ,  it kind of made me feel dirty .  let ' s face it ,  a white guy watching something like this to laugh at the outfits and the things the characters say is essentially getting an enjoyment out of it that is racist :  how ridiculously those black people dress ,  what silly things they say .  i wasn ' t really enjoying it ,  wasn ' t laughing ,  and wasn ' t looking forward to watching the rest .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > later that night ,  when i was in a  " much more relaxed state ,  "  i watched the rest  and legitimately loved it .  like disco godfather ,  which i had watched a few days previously ,  this has a warmth and sweetness at its core that makes it likable even when it ' s silly or violent .  the character of dolemite has an element of self - parody about him that makes the whole thing fun ,  and the appearance of several actors who were also in disco godfather implies that we ' re watching the group effort of a bunch of friends who just want to make something fun together .  even the poor dubbing ,  karate fights ,  and everything else just makes it that much more charming .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > what i find interesting about the dolemite films is that they have some moral ambiguity i don ' t see in other blaxploitation films ,  and certainly in very few mainstream films .  in this one ,  there is an african - american woman who gives a speech about the  ( white )  mayor ,  saying  " he has done more for the black community than anyone .  "  we later find out that the mayor is ,  surprise ,  corrupt ,  but i like that the movie would present this woman as essentially misguided and not try to  " redeem "  her in some other way .  there ' s also the figure of the hamburger pimp ,  who is presented as a useless junkie ,  and no one makes an effort to find some redeeming ,  socially positive angle to what he is ,  he just is .  in disco godfather the religious character lady reed plays is presented as just nuts for wanting to pray for her child ,  hopelessly lost to angel dust .  i like that the films would present such harshly critical portrayals of people in their own community without sugar - coating or trying to redeem them to make them more palatable .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > there are a lot of hootworthy elements ,  such as when dolemite says  " move over and let me pass ,  or i ' m gonna be pulling these hush puppies out your muthatf *  *  a *  *  .  "  there is queen bee reaching over and answering the phone :   " dolemite ' s total experience .  "  and you will not be able to miss  ( though you may wish to cover your eyes )  the extended nude scene by the repulsive mayor .  i am all for mustachioed pervy older men ,  but even i have limits   - and my limits are usually a few miles past most people ' s ,  so be warned .  the dvd i had is clearly edited ,  which is noticeable in certain of the dialogue scenes ,  and at the end ,  when dolemite ' s killing of a major character with his bare hands obviously excludes the main event .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > if you do get the dvd ,  however ,  be sure to watch all three trailers for the dolemite films ,  as they are a hoot .  i wasn ' t going to watch the human tornado ,  but after seeing that trailer ,  you ' d better believe that i am .  also ,  there is a scene in the dolemite trailer that i don ' t remember from the movie when dolemite swings at a mexican - looking thug ,  obviously misses ,  and the guy flips himself into a nearby car trunk .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > after watching the first half ,  i was going to say to skip this and watch disco godfather ,  as the film - making and story has marginally improved ,  but after really enjoying the second half ,  i would advise watching this one over disco godfather ,  as this one is even more exuberantly fun ,  outrageous ,  and good - natured  and has those toasts which ,  even if one doesn ' t understand the roots and nuances of the form ,  are still something to see .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  -  -  check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies ,  cinema de merde ,  cinemademerde . com
