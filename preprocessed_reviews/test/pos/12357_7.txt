i thought it would be more fantastic a tale .  but the subject is rather down to earth compared to the story about the death carriage i was expecting .  in fact there is much more of a social drama .  as usual in the  " european authors '  movies "  .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > actors are interesting ,  not overacting as in the average silent movie .  images are not so good as to be stuck in your mind as in bergman ' s smultronstället .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > this is true the comparison between the two movies is the main point here .  smultronstället begins with a vision of a death carriage wherein sjöström ' s character can see his own body .  there are clocks without hands .  he is compelled to look back on what he has done wrong .  there is a vision of his happy family in the country .  in körkarlen sjöström ' s wife doesn ' t cheat on him before his eyes but she wants to flee with the little children because it would never get any better with him .  eventually ,  edit ' s confession is some kind of a live judgement .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > well i would just add that sjöström destroying the door with an axe because his wife locked it and plans to go away with the children reminded me of the shining .  which was much more of a fantasy tale with death hanging around .
