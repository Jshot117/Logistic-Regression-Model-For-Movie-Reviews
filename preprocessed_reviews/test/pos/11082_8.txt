true stories make the best stories don ' t they ?  there ' s always something enjoyable about a story ,  be it novel or movie or whatever ,  simply by the fact that it ' s real makes the story all the more fascinating .  this movie is based on a true story of two young american men ,  one a government employee and falcon enthusiast  chris boyce  ( timothy hutton )   and the other  andrew daulton lee  ( sean penn )   is a drug dealer .  these two begin selling government ,  mostly cia ,  secrets in 1975 to the soviet union .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the film focuses on the human aspect of the two men ,  as well as their growing personal problems  ( especially penn ' s character with ever - worsening drug addictions )  ,  rather than glorifying their status as traitors to america ,  which would ,  no doubt ,  hurt the film ' s credibility in the us .  boyce gradually becomes more cautious and eventually frustrated and paranoid as their dealings drag on and they dig ever deeper into treacherous territory .  daulton becomes more dependent and addicted to cocaine and heroin as he becomes more frightened ,  and more desperate to maintain control over a situation he has no control over  on top of which ,  he already has problems with the law .  the torment of boyce and daulton ' s families because of the way they lead their lives is also well portrayed and adds well to the idea that espionage against one ' s country ,  even if thought to be done justly ,  leads only to major problems and the ruination of lives  including the degradation of the friendship and trust between the two main characters .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > here ' s the breakdown :  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the good :  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - hutton and penn each did extensive research on the characters to capture their individual look and feel ,  so they ' re portrayed with extensive depth and realism .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - the acting is excellent .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - the atmosphere of paranoia builds quite well .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - the story is fascinating ,  and of course ,  as one based on actual events ,  it has some added kick .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - nice sets .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - the soviets working with the boyce and daulton are portrayed very well ,  and not stereotyped or given evil consciences just for the sake of making them look bad .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > didn ' t hurt it ,  didn ' t help :  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - the music is alright ,  nothing perfect though .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - sound effects are occasionally a little iffy  such was the case with a lot of films from the seventies through the eighties .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the bad :  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - chris boyce  ( timothy hutton )  has a relationship with a woman that we hardly know .  because of boyce ' s trouble brewing with the us and soviet governments ,  her life can be put in jeopardy  but this isn ' t as expanded upon as it feels it should ' ve been .  minor problem ,  though .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the ugly :  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - the apparent simplicity required to sell government secrets is a little unnerving .  nothing like a constant state of unreadiness to keep the masses feeling as unsafe as possible .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > memorable scene :  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - seeing the first cia report accidentally sent to the wrong place with the reason being ,   " rough night .  "  < br  /  >  < br  /  > this was another film that suffered massive delays due to the controversial content of the story .  studios and producers didn ' t see how a movie about two american traitors could ever be accepted by american audiences .  luckily ,  it ' s filmed and portrayed with a high degree of class and quality .  of course ,  it helps that the traitorous anti - heroes aren ' t portrayed heroically  more like a couple young men who ' ve made gross errors in judgment in their lives .  as such ,  it becomes a very human drama ,  and one portrayed very well and very believably .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > acting :  9 / 10 story :  10 / 10 atmosphere :  8 / 10 cinematography :  8 / 10 character development :  9 / 10 special effects / make - up :  8 / 10  ( little quantity ,  high quality )  nudity / sexuality :  2 / 10  ( one scene in a strip club )  violence / gore :  7 / 10  ( no gore ,  just some violence )  music :  7 / 10 direction :  9 / 10 < br  /  >  < br  /  > cheesiness :  0 / 10 crappiness :  0 / 10 < br  /  >  < br  /  > overall :  8 / 10 < br  /  >  < br  /  > if you like films about espionage and spies ,  then you can ' t go wrong here .  if you like dramatic films with a strong focus on the humanity of the characters ,  then this may also work for you .  highly recommended .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > www . residenthazard . com
