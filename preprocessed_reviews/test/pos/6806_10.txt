my daughter already wrote a review of this movie in my sign in .  .  . but i want to add a few words .   < br  /  >  < br  /  >   national velvet '  was one of my two favorite movies as a child .   ( the other being  ' the wizard of oz   .  )  the cinematography ,  the acting ,  the script ,  and the music all came together is such a wonderful little heart felt drama that it can still bring tears to my jaded eyes .  based on a book by enid bagnold ,  the script followed the book quite well .  the characters are so thoughtfully created .  it ' s easy to become emotionally involved with the entire family and the quaint little irish village in which they live .  the premise .  .  . complete outsider believes in her horse and herself enough to chance a try at the greatest horse race in the world .  .  . is awe inspiring to any young person ,  especially a young girl in the 40 ' s .  .  . a time when girls were sometimes ignored as humans beings let alone athletes .  you would have to be terribly hard - boiled not to appreciate it ' s merit .   < br  /  >  < br  /  > but the perspective i cherished most about this movie is the unabridged innocence in it ' s moral message .  .  it ' s almost magical how  ' mom and apple pie '  the movies were back then .  i was really taken aback by the imdb reviewer who asked .  .  .  ' was the world ever really this trusting ?  '  and then proceeded to chastize the director for his complacency regarding   unchaperoned '  overnight travel involving the two main characters .  my answer to his question is an unequivocal yes !  !  !  !  the movie going world was that trusting in the 40 ' s .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > my grandparents remember taking my mother to this movie when it was released .  then my mother took me to see it when i was young ,  and my daughter was lucky enough to be born at a time when she could watch it repeatedly on video tape .  now we have it on dvd .  it ' s been a family favorite for generations ,  albeit generations of horse lovers .  it was never about sex .  .  . it ' s about coming of age !  it ' s about believing in yourself and working hard to reach your goals .  also ,  so old fashioned it wasn ' t even about the prize money !  it ' s about the girl child who understood her horse had what it took to   be the best '  .  and yes ,  the director was indeed concerned with elizabeth taylor ' s lack of physical development because the book made a big deal about velvet brown  ( liz taylor ' s character )  having to cut her hair and bind her chest so that she could pass as a male jockey when she went to the grand national steeplechase .  this was a guys only sport back then .  .  . i think there have only been 12 women ever to compete in this race .  it ' s almost insulting that anyone would bother to think the lolita thing about this particular movie .  .  . besides ,  anyone having had anything at all to do with an adolescent girl and her horse would know that the only thing they ever think about with stars in their eyes have four hooves and a tail .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > and now for a great bit of trivia .  .  . the stunt riding was performed by the now famous   horse whisperer '  ,  monty roberts .  i believe he is given mentioned for his riding in the movie credits .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > i give this movie a 10 out of 10 !  i never get tired of watching it again .
