centres on czech ww2 pilots    the older frantisek ,  the boyish impulsive karel and in the background the quiet piano - playing honza .  as the film opens ,  it is 1950 ,  the war is over and frantisek and honza are imprisoned in a former monastery .  in their now soviet - controlled native country they are  ' enemy of the people '  .  honza is severely maltreated by his communist countrymen and dies .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > in 1939 many pilots manage to escape german - occupied europe and make their way to england where they join the raf .  notwithstanding their high motivation and experience they face raf reluctance and british stiff upper lip .  finally they fight gallantly in the battle of britain .  however ,  frantisek and karel find their friendship severely tested when they both fall for the same woman .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > in terms of romantic sub - plot ,  this is very similar to the hollywood production pearl harbour .  however ,  given the context of the film and frantisek ' s eventual fate ,  it is also possible to read the english woman ' s treatment of the two men as symbolic of british treatment of the czech and polish raf pilots :  conveniently forgetting them once the war is over .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > in addition ,  the film is a lot less cliché than pearl harbour and the characters are more fully realised .  dark blue world also scores in terms of its stunning aerial dogfights ,  which were seamlessly created using a mixture of models ,  actual live - action aerial filming and out - takes from the 1969 epic the battle of britain .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > in short ,  dark blue world is a well - made ,  moving ,  thought - provoking and exciting drama that puts the likes of pearl harbour to shame .  highly recommended .
