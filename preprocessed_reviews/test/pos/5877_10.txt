this superb 40 ' s post war classic ,  tends to be overlooked these < br  /  >  < br  /  > days .  when it was released in 1945 ,  it cleaned up at the 1946 < br  /  >  < br  /  > oscars ,  mostly at the expense of  ` it ' s a wonderful life .  '  both films were up for best film  ,  best < br  /  >  < br  /  > director ,  and best actor ,  all won by  Â‘ best years '  .  frederic march  ,  < br  /  >  < br  /  > and dana andrews along with an amateur actor harold russell  (  a < br  /  >  < br  /  > real life soldier , who lost both hands in an explosion ,  )  play the < br  /  >  < br  /  > returning soldiers ,  finding life is very different  ,  from what they < br  /  >  < br  /  > remember .  myrna loy is superb as march ' s wife ,  who has to keep < br  /  >  < br  /  > the family together while he has been away . the tear jerking  < br  /  >  < br  /  > scene where march and loy are reunited is magnificent .  all three < br  /  >  < br  /  > men find that they have problems readjusting to post war life ,  not < br  /  >  < br  /  > least russell coming to terms with artificial hands ,  and his finance < br  /  >  < br  /  >  ( cathy o ' donnell  )  trying to be too helpful .  sam goldywn is quoted that he doesn ' t care if the film makes no < br  /  >  < br  /  > money at all ,  as long as everyone in america sees the film  , so they < br  /  >  < br  /  > will appreciate what these men went through .  if any film is worth 10 out of 10 ,  it is this one .
