i have seen  ' the sea within '  today and i loved it .  the actors of the movie are wonderful  ( specially javier bardem ,  of course )  ,  but i thought that belén rueda would have a better role .  lola dueñas ,  clara segura and ,  specially ,  mabel rivera perform excellent interpretations .  and i cannot forget celso bugallo and joan dalmau  ( brother and father of the protagonist )  .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > there are two technical aspects i loved very much :  aguirresarobe ' s photography and the score by amenábar himself .  i liked the song ,   ' negra sombra '   (  ' dark shadow '  )  ,  by luz casal with music of carlos núñez .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > in short ,  i think that the spanish academy should choose  ' the sea within '  in order to compete in the oscar awards .  i liked other spanish productions ,  such as almodóvar ' s  ' bad education '  ,  but amenábar ' s film is much better than them .   ' the sea within '  deserves all the awards .
