i feel really bad for reviewing this movie because i wish that i had only watched it as a concept production .  the covenant looked like it could have been a really original piece ,  but sadly they lose the great idea in the translation to the screen .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the story follows four  ( five )  teens that are the descendants of the families that started the town of ipswitch a survivors of the salem witch trials .  they also happen to be a part of the secret sect called  " the covenant "  .  their power must be used sparingly as it drains their life - force in small amounts and is highly addictive .  in theory this would make a pretty good action sci - fi movieor at least an interesting teeny flick .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > but there were just too many glaring downfalls that don ' t allow this movie to reach its plot ' s full potential .  that acting wasn ' t good ,  the sound track was mediocre and we found a lot of unnecessary sync issues .  for sure the biggest issue is the poor editing job .  the movie has little to no coherent flow and makes one fight to keep a mental timeline or any feel of pacing .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the movie has it ' s moments ,  but overall was a little disappointing .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > a witchy 4 / 10
