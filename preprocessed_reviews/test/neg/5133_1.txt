i loved heavenly creatures and make it a point to catch it whenever it is on .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > so ,  imagine my delight when i discovered love  &  suicide while browsing netflix .  echoing heavenly creatures ,  an easy choice ,  to the top of my queue it went .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > i watched it last ,  made myself comfy ,  and waited .  what i thought was some crappy preview of a stoned high school student ' s prank film project  ( i laughed out loud once or twice ,  thinking  " that just lowered the bar of straight to video "  )  turned out to be the movie .  horrible acting ,  amateur direction ,  weak dialog .  i usually enjoy low budget films ,  there is something tangible and real about them because they cannot afford the superficial stuff to distract from the  " meat "      the acting ,  the direction ,  the plot ,  the story .  i would liken it to a student who hasn ' t studied for an exam goes in knowing he is going to fail and just puts his head on the desk and sleeps .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > in someone else ' s hands the plot would have serious potential .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > do not expect magic or even a cult classics like ,  say ,  divine ' s polyester ,  or showgirls ,  at least there you learn to expect bad acting .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > love  &  suicide went from bad ,  to worse ,  to the worst movie i have ever seen .
