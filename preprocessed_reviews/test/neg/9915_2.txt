a wasted effort .  on the surface it ' s a typical disaster movie :  we ' re involved in the lives of a few people who get caught up in the big event .  however ,  the script is so awful and there ' s so much explaining of the characters '  background within the dialogue that we feel we ' re being treated like morons .  even sesame street didn ' t explain the origins of mr snuffleupagus or how mr hooper died :  we can work it out .  someone thought that entering  ' enron '  into the script would give it currency when discussing power companies .  the acting is by and large bland ,  with the exception of the older performers  ( randy quaid ,  brian dennehy )  ,  and after the first hour ,  i couldn ' t care less about who the storms took out .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > but maybe there are the special effects to watch .  sadly ,  no .  even on a 20 - year - old tv set i could see one tractor and trailer were computer - generated Â— badly .  maybe there are budgetary limitations ,  so i can forgive that one .  footage of a plane trying to land looked pretty real ,  but i kept telling myself i had seen that before .  this site confirms it :  it was from an earlier film ,  nowhere to land .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > so in summary ,  the only good bits are from another film ,  and when you see the best action sequences compressed into a 30 - second network promo ,  it makes category 6 look quite good .  my advice :  rely on your network to do some good 30 - second clips ,  watch them ,  and save yourself two nights .
