pick a stereotype ,  any stereotype  ( whether racial ,  sexual ,  cultural ,  etc .  )  ,  and i bet you ' ll find it in wassup rockers .  do you think that all hispanic teenage boys are stupid ,  hairy ,  inarticulate ,  and dirty troublemakers ?  are hispanic girls sex - crazed ,  easy ,  ass - baring sluts ?  do black people all want to start fights and carry guns ?  do all gay people throw themed parties with pink drinks and ask young boys to model for them ?  are all white teenage girls rich ,  stuck - up princesses who are bored with white teenage boys and are looking for something a little more dangerous ?  if you answered  " yes "  to any of the previous questions ,  you ,  my friend ,  are a bigot ,  and you will love wassup rockers .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > director larry clark likes to shock his audiences  ( i was 15 years old the first time i saw kids and i think that ' s why i ' m still a virgin )  ,  but wassup rockers isn ' t shockingÂ… it ' s just bad .  he tries to be edgy and realistic with his minimal dialog and body - hair close - ups ,  but these characters and this story are completely unrealistic .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > simply put ,  wassup rockers is a teenage boy ' s fantasy .  what 14 - year - old boy doesn ' t want to be a skater who gets in trouble ,  crashes parties ,  drinks 40s ,  and is told by the hot ,  rich ,  white girl that his uncircumcised penis  " looks dangerous ?  "  besides that demographic ,  i really don ' t know who ' s going to enjoy this film .
