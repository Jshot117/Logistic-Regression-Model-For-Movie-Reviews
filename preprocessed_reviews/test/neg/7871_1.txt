this is 1 hour and 24 minutes of pure boredom !  !  < br  /  >  < br  /  > in this  ' action '  -  movie ,  even the gun baldwin uses  ( hk g3a3 )  sucks .  it was sent to recycling by armed forces worldwide in the mid eighties ,  and is now only used by terrorists ,  bank robbers and military museums .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > if i had known this movie was this bad ,  i would rather watch 10 episodes of macgyver saving the planet .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > no groove ,  no drive and no feel .  watch the tupperware - channel    it ' s more exiting than this sorry excuse for a movie .  this movie doesn ' t deserve a  ' 0 '  on the scale .  better luck next time ,  baldwin .  until then ,  i ' ll sit here watch my toenails grow    that is far more exiting than  ' target '  .
