this film was produced by producers releasing corp .   ( prc )  ,  among the so - called  " poverty row "  film studios of the 1930s and 40s .  so you can imagine how little money was spent making it .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the music is forgettable .  cast member gerra young does exhibit an operatic - quality voice ,  but is sort of a discount deanna durbin .  the imdb database doesn ' t show any other film appearances for her ,  so let ' s hope she was able to move on to some kind of position in grand opera .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the opening credits for the print recently broadcast by turner classic movies indicates this film has been preserved by the national film museum .  this immediately begs the question Â— why ?   < br  /  >  < br  /  > are their resources so plentiful that they can afford to preserve junk ?  some low - budget or b musicals of that era have redeeming features which make them worthwhile .  this film has none .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > in my opinion ,  skip this movie .  it really wastes an hour of your time .
