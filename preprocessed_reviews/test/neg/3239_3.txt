based on the excellent novel ,  watchers by dean koontz ,  is this extremely awful motion picture that probably shouldn ' t be viewed by anyone .  not since  " the running man "  have i seen a book butchered so far beyond recognition .  the difference ,  however ,  is that  " the running man "  film was still enjoyable as an amusing action film laden down a million catch phrases .  this film nope ,  nothing remotely amusing .  in fact ,  if you love the book ,  as i do ,  you ' ll hate this bastardization even more .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  *  * warning *  * contains spoilers *  *  rightio ,  i ' m basically going to tell you the story here ,  almost in it ' s entirety .  why ?  because you ,  dear reader ,  do not also need to suffer through this abomination  it ' s okay for me ,  because i enjoy watching crap .  because i like complaining about sh * tty things .  now ,  on to the nasty :  this film revolves around a boy and his mother running away from the government and a mutant - monkey - creature - soldier which escaped from a destroyed government genetics lab with a super - smart golden retriever which the  " hero "  calls  " furface .  "  groan trust me ,  in the novel ,  this story rocked .  i ' ll get to that later .  anyway ,  the hero is none other that dreamy boy - child corey haim .  oh ,  i ' m not kidding .  our hero runs around ,  crackly voice and all ,  trying to convince his mom to help save this dog from the  " evil government "  which birthed him and made him genetically ultra - smart .  the monkey - creature ,  retardedly referred to as an  " oxcom "   ( god help us )  is also a genetic - stew of a creature built to be the ultimate fighter on battlefields of the future .  michael ironside  ( total recall ,  starship troopers  always plays a badass )  is also in this film ,  and no ,  i couldn ' t figure out how anyone convinced him this would be a good idea .  he plays a government agent with the nso hunting the dog and creature .  oh yeah ,  here ' s some spoilerama :  he ' s also a creation from the government ,  and the same lab ,  and lo and behold spends most of the movie being a prick and killing people  and all that killing is supposed to be done by the monkey - soldier .  instead of a rockin '  kick - ass ,  creepy horror film ,  we have a rectal hemorrhage of a teenybopper horror flick .  the dog ' s intelligence is discovered all - too - conveniently ,  and believed easier than we believe we can see clouds by looking outside .  breakdown !  !  < br  /  >  < br  /  > change from book to film :  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - lead character  ( travis )  turned from man to boy - child .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - man ' s love interest in book  ( nora )  ,  is now his mother  and all her depth and character growth is completely gone .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - lem johnson ,  black man ,  is now white mr .  ironside .  this matters as the character ' s strength was built on his heritage in the book .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - relationship between two authority figures completely ignored ,  lem now kills the guy who was originally his best friend .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - one principle character in the book is now totally absent ,  the  " immortal "  that hunted the heroes -  - maybe this is supposed to be ironside ,  but then why is he someone else ?  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - dog never receives deserving name of  " einstein "  in the movie .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - no part of the book took place in a high school  at least nothing that had strong bearing on the plot .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - takes place over a matter of days ,  rather months like the book  unrealistic pacing .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - corey haim ' s girlfriend in the movie appeared in no more than two chapters in the book -  - and they never met in the book .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - character of lem johnson is no longer cool - headed ;  instead ,  he ' s a total asshole that bullies his way through people .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - hero travis was part of delta force  ( military segment specializing in hunting terrorists )  ,  instead ,  his dad ,  who is never seen in the film ,  was part of that group .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - perceived intelligence in the monster now totally absent .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - subplots involving soviets and the mob completely gutted out of the story .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - these are just the most obnoxious changes ,  and the one ' s i could remember off hand  ( and a day later )  .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the good :  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - eventually ,  after 90 - odd minutes of pain and mental anguish ,  the movie ended .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > didn ' t hurt it ,  didn ' t help it :  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - michael ironside  usually ,  i like him .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - the dog is still fairly likable .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - wacky  " totally 80 ' s "  title screen .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the bad :  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - okay ,  the writing for one is extremely awful .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - the direction is so half - assed that anyone watching the film will feel superior to everyone involved in it .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - the acting is crappy and weak ,  especially from corey haim .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - loose ,  weak ,  watered down story .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - the monster looks just pathetic ,  that is ,  when we are actually allowed to see the bloody thing .  its head is gigantically over - sized ,  the yellow eyes that were so much a part of the thing in the book are seen for no more than two seconds .  instead of a lean ,  powerful ,  fast ,  intelligent killing machine ,  we have some jackass in a puke - ugly monkey suit forced upon us .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - absolutely no character development .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - even the violence and gore are done poorly ,  for f * ck sakes ,  this is supposed to be a horror film !  !  usually violence is at least done well !  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the ugly :  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - the idea that dean koontz whored out his brilliant novel to become this filthy f * cking piece of sh * t brings me dangerously close to vomiting all over myself and anyone near me .  there are movies worse than this  ( headache - inducing as that idea may seem )  ,  but so far ,  only  " alien vs predator ,  "  at least to me ,  is a bigger travesty and more painful disappointment .   < br  /  >  < br  /  > memorable scene :  watching the end credits start .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > acting :  3 / 10 story :  4 / 10  ( the novel was really good ,  this is just terrible )  atmosphere :  5 / 10 cinematography :  4 / 10 character development :  1 / 10 special effects / make - up :  4 / 10 nudity / sexuality :  0 / 10 violence / gore :  4 / 10 music :  5 / 10 direction :  3 / 10 < br  /  >  < br  /  > cheesiness :  7 / 10 crappiness :  9 / 10 < br  /  >  < br  /  > overall :  3 / 10 < br  /  >  < br  /  > i would recommend that no one watch this movie ever ,  except for a few extreme die - hard horror fans  and only if you haven ' t read the novel .  instead ,  i would recommend that anyone interested in this avoid it entirely and buy / check / borrow the book .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > www . residenthazard . com
