first of all ,  this movie is so confused that it is almost impossible to summarize it ,  since i myself did not understand this horrible story .  further ,  the unknown cast ,  leaded by an actress called laura mennell ,  is simply awful .  the expressions and screams of the character sara tobias are laughable and ridiculous ,  confusing grimaces with acting .  last but not the least ,  there are many favorable reviews about this flick in imdb as follows :  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  top notch -  can ' t wait to see more of the directors work    the author has only one review in imdb on 24 september 2004 ;  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  incredibly shot ,  amazingly intense    the author has only one review in imdb on 12 august 2004 ;   < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  not your typical blood and gore ,  in fact better .  7 / 10    the author has only one review in imdb on 13 february 2005 ;  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  as intense as asian horror !  !   -  the author has only one review in imdb on 14 november 2004 .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > coincidence ?  or are they the parents ,  relatives ,  friends or people hired by the production to promote this crap ?  my vote is three .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > title  ( brazil )  :   " 11 . 11    a nova profecia "   (  " 11 . 11    the new prophecy "  )
