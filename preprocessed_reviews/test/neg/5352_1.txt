first things first  -  though i believe joel schumacher is at best a mediocre director and more often  ( as here )  downright bad ,  the lion ' s share of the blame for this ugly travesty of a film must go to john grisham whose novel this is based on .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > set at an undetermined point in time  ( the 50s ?  the 70s ?  now ?  )  ,  the film opens with the rape and murder of a child by rednecks so caricatured that their purpose seems to be to reassure racists that  " at least we ' re not that bad "  cut to the bad guys arriving at the courthouse when the girls father ,  samuel l jackson ,  fearful they will get off on some technicality ,  guns them down in cold blood before the trial .   < br  /  >  < br  /  > the setting is a  ' deep south '  that probably never existed  -  the few black characters live in shacks and seem to pick cotton ,  the dyed - in - the - wool racists  ( kiefer sutherland is a cartoon version of a klansman )  are laughable in their villainy .  the set - piece is the trial :  for the defence ,  are the  " good guys "   -  a milquetoast lawyer played by matthew mcconaughey as though in a coma ,  his assistant played by sandra bullock ' s breasts  ( she doesn ' t seem to serve any other narrative purpose )  and donald sutherland as the requisite drunk - lawyer - who - sobers - up - to - fight - the - good - fight .  for the prosecution ,  kevin spacey goes through the motions of being demon spawn ,  while in the town at large ,  crosses are burned ,  witness are intimidated and the local citizens don ' t seem to care  < br  /  >  < br  /  > some of the reviews here claim the film immoral ,  since surely samuel jackson is a killer and should trust to the forces of the law rather than get off on a feeble heart - tugging piece of oratory by matthew mcconaughey .  to be honest ,  objectionable though the underlying message  " vigilante justice is good "  might be ,  everything about the movie stinks :  the characterizations are pitiful ,  the acting leaden ,  the direction plodding ,  the screenplay and the dialogue almost verging on parody .  peter menzies lush ,  50s technicolor cinematography is pretty but derivative .   < br  /  >  < br  /  > and it goes on for nearly two and a half hours !  !   < br  /  >  < br  /  > what ' s left to say ?  this is a waste of 141 minutes of anyone ' s life ,  it is tedious ,  vacuous and hammy ,  and ,  almost as an afterthought ,  it is morally repugnant .
