apart from the beautiful imagery thanks to new zealand cinematographer alun bollinger ,  this film is not worth seeing .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the storyline is so fragmented and lost that it ' s hard to know what is going on at any given time ,  and just when you think you ' re following then the direction changes again ,  like a lost bi - polar puppy dog .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the musical score is awful ,  relying too heavily on extremely emotive pieces that try to force the audience into feeling a certain way ,  as if the instruments were acting as an emotions queue sheet     ' feel sad here '  ;   ' feel shocked here '  ;   ' feel scared here '  .  on top of that ,  the repetitive samples used over and over again leave the audience on the verge of laughter .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > gone are the days of silent film ,  where musical instruments were the sole portrayal of voice    but you wouldn ' t think so while watching river queen .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the voice - over was so over - utilised that one has to wonder if this film really even needed any accompanying imagery .  it could have easily been a radio play although even then it would be hard to follow the story .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > and the stolen ideas from jane campion ' s the piano are too obvious to overlook .  not only are the beach and forest shots almost identical to those in the piano    perhaps some of this comes down to alun bollinger ' s camera work on the latter    but the voice - over feeling and levels too are strikingly close .  and who could forget when holly hunter ' s character has her wings clipped ,  in the form of her index finger being cut off by sam neill .  does it remind you of when wiremu has his  ' trigger finger '  amputated ,  and surprisingly too with an axe ?  i thought so .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > all in all i cannot recommend this film for viewing ,  unless you wear some ear - muffs and just go with the scenery in mind .
