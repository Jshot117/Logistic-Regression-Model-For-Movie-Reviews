this series is formulaic and boring .  the episodes are the same thing every week ,  simply with slightly varied settings .  some purely evil character does some dastardly deed ,  walker goes after him ,  and it ends in a karate match .  the villains are super - cliché super - stereotypical evil villains ,  the good guys are all pure ,  honest and saintly ,  and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic .  after about 2 episodes ,  the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least discerning fans .  certainly not norris ' s best work .  his other work may be cliché but it usually does not drag on for weeks .  if you enjoy formulaic , boring ,  repetitive clichéd snooze - fests ,  then this is for you .
