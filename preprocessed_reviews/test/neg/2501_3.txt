as a serious horror fan ,  i get that certain marketing ploys are used to sell movies ,  especially the really bad ones .  so i wouldn ' t call it naiveté that i assumed this was softcore horror ripping off cannibal  /  zombi  /  jungle holocaust .  unfortunately ,  i was completely wrong as this is very hardcore .  i should have realized that when i saw the odd  " no actual or identifiable minor was used "  warning .  notice the identifiable part as though he is daring us to catch him ?  a group of scientists ,  half of whom are pretty women in bikinis ,  are led by a sea captain with a penchant for 69ing on the beach ,  in search for a mutated native killing villagers .  due to a nuclear bomb detonated on a supposedly evacuated island ,  the radiation turned this last man into a rapist /  killer .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > writer /  actor george eastman is the only one trying here and succeeds in keeping his clothes on .  the sex scenes are whacked out .  women walk around nude exuding a strange overconfidence and one even asks for rape when her husband turns her down .  well ,  two chicks slapping each other naturally turns into a lesbo scene because women are horndogs .  i saw the chick toss another chicks salad and finger herself .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > if there is anything you should know about this film ,  it is that .  because the rest of this insane movie is just the same .  oh ,  who am i kidding ?  there is a ton more to tell here .  like the white  " duchess "  that pays for 2 black guys to tag team her in a parlor .  or the  " duchess "  taking off her top to use as a bandage when the captain cuts himself .  when he refuses her advances ,  she starts crying .  so being the good gentleman he is ,  he reluctantly lets her pleasure him in front of the other crew members .  i was honestly waiting for the pizza guy to show up and the  " duchess "  to ask if there is any other way to pay him .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > and all of this happens before they depart for the island to conduct their research .  wait ,  i thought this was a zombie flick ?  but the zombie doesn ' t enter until the 73min mark ,  but by that time everyone else has been  " entered "  plenty .  i found myself hitting fast forward a few scenesor several .  this is my first splatter porn flick and i don ' t think it does that subgenre any justice .  i guess it is the woman in me talking when i say that i would like more plot and less sweaty ,  slobbering ,  hairy sex .  funny thing is this could have worked as a decent horror film as the idea of atomic bombing mutating a bitter man and killing his family ,  was a good one .  even eastman ' s character shakes his head and walks away from a couple copulating .  it makes me wonder if it was the character or the writer himself that was disgusted .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > i don ' t feel like going into the sound or film quality because you should have already guessed it was bad .  this production was shot back to back with 3 other movies including erotic nights of the living dead ,  which sports most of the same cast .  eastman has said this was done because everyone wanted a vacation and a paycheck .  nevermind ,  i feel like talking about the sound suddenly .  the sound was weird during the sex scenes because while the cast is speaking italian ,  it seems as though they recorded english voiceovers and played that over their dialogue .  so while 2 people are boning ,  i can clearly hear someone in the background say ,   " no !  yes !  wonderful !  wait !  "  there was a slightly amusing italian score that couldn ' t save this movie .  the sfx were minimal at best and consisted of some blood in only a few scenes .  and i would like to point out that there were no violent rape scenes as the bright warning label said on the dvd cover  ( ahem ,  another marketing ploy )  ,  so no fear there .  only fear the bad movie .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > presented in widescreen 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio .  i watched the region 1 not rated version running at 113min released in 2005 by exploitation digital .  there is apparently a xxx version by alfa digital ,  which is the same running time ,  so i doubt anything is different .  prices vary ,  but you shouldn ' t pay more than  $ 25 . 00 for a copy .  or as i would recommend ,  pay nothing and pretend it doesn ' t exist .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > favorite quote :  shipmate ,   " civilians are bad luck .  women are bad luck .  they ' re scientists too ?  they must really be monsters .  "  dvd extras :  original trailer with hardcore shots  &  kills to make it look more interesting than it is ,  trailers for ss hell camp ,  emmanuelle ,   &  enotld ,  and a very informative interview with eastman .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > bottom line :  lame porno ,  but even weaker as a horror film .  either get real porn or watch real horror .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > rating :  3 / 10 by molly celaschi www . horroryearbook . com
