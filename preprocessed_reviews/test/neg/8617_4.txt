there ' s a good story well hidden and never really used !   < br  /  >  < br  /  > the film is short and overly dependent on action and thematic photography ;  somehow ,  character and story development have been forgotten .  what is left is muddled and superficial .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > turn off your brain and watch  you will probably find that the time goes quickly enough ,  but unless you are the sort of person that finds soaps deep and meaningful ,  you are going to get no real satisfaction from this film .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > watch only if you have nothing better to do and then only if someone else pays for the video rental .
