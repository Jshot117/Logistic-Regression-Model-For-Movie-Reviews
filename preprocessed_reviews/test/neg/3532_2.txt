sighthe stupid government once again attempted to create an inexhaustible and indestructible soldier ,  and of course the experiments went terribly wrong ,  burdening us with a half man - half mutant who pukes an awful lot and squeaks like a little girl whenever he ' s upset .  lance henriksen stars as the honest scientist who immediately quit the experiment upon hearing it was a military project ,  but he returns  ( bringing the whole family with him )  when he finds out his beloved guinea pig has gone on a killing spree .   " mind ripper "  certainly is a watchable horror movie ,  but it ' s very unoriginal and features pretty much every lame cliché you can think off  ( including the estranged father / rebellious teenage son sub plot .  .  . yawn )  .  the characters are like wooden puppets ,  the dumbest things are being said and done and there ' s a completely pointless dream - sequence .  .  . coming from the monster !  !  !  there ' s a handful of interesting gory scenes to enjoy and some of the isolated desert - locations are effectively eerie .  lance henriksen is adequate as always ,  even though this is yet another inferior production he stars ,  and giovanni ribisi surely deserved a better motion picture to make his debut in .  for some reason ,  this anonymous 90 ' s thriller is also known as  " the hills have eyes part 3 "  .  is it because it handles about members of the same family being terrorized in the desert ?  is it because wes craven was once again involved ,  as a producer this time ?  or maybe it ' s because the monster gets bald near the end like the freaky michael berryman in the 1977 original ?  who knows .  .  . who cares ?  wes craven probably financed this project because his son co - wrote the script and it ' s always moving to discover that your offspring is equally untalented as you are .  not recommended !
