laughable .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > clichéd .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > overdoses on style to compensate for poor writing .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > remember when mtv actually used to air music videos and other shows besides reality shows ?  aeon flux  ( 2005 )  is based upon one such show    a cartoon from the mid - 90s    featuring a superhuman female protagonist in black latex clothing .  aeon ,  played by the lovely charlize theron in this adaptation ,  is a cold detached rebel who is as dexterous as a line - dancer and as deadly as a viper - snake .  she needs to be ,  if she expects to kick the asses of the totalitarian government .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > i love science fiction ,  but hate the sudden influx of half - assed futuristic dystopian technology - overdosed films like the island  ( 2005 )  and equilibrium  ( 2002 )   ( bottom of the pile )  .  aeon flux has all the problems that are present in these films ,  but amplified .  that is ,  there is nothing original left to show so they compensate for it with the sleek style that matrix  ( 1999 )  catalyzed .  the special effects are therefore sensational in aeon flux which earns it a few points ,  but scratch the surface and there is literally nothing there .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > to make matters worse ,  all performances in this film are atrocious and some actually wound me to watch .  charlize theron ' s character aeon flux is interwoven with the most cheesy tough - chick schtick and it seems as though the director karyn kusama cannot quite decide where to go with her next    should she make her more detached or more emotional ?  she doesn ' t know !  let ' s go both ways !  imagine you take a shotgun ,  load it chock - full of character developments of different sorts and there fire into a random mess .  this is the character of aeon flux .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the film aeon flux puts forward all the  ' mandatory '  ideas in a dystopian society  -  individual vs .  society ,  nature vs .  science ,  emotion vs .  cold reason ,  etc .  you ' ve seen all of this before ,  and better done at that .  go read orwell ,  bradbury or huxley ,  or even watch logan ' s run  ( 1976 )  or blade runner  ( 1982 )  .  .  .  anything !  avoid this viciously uninvolving cheese - fest for as long as you can .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > 3 / 10
