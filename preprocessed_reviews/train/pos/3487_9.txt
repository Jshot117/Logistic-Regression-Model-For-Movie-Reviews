wrestlemania 14 is not often looked as one of the great wrestlemania ' s but i would personally put it ,  in my top 5 ,  if not the top 3 .  it has so many great things ,  and it truly signified the birth of the attitude era ,  which was wwe ' s best era ,  in my opinion .  hbk has the heart of a lion ,  and him putting over austin like he did ,  on his way out ,  was pure class on his part .  it has one of the hottest crowds you will ever see ,  and it has j . r and the king at their announcing best !  .   < br  /  >  < br  /  > matches .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > 15  Â–  team battle royal loud pop for l . o . d ' s return .  i ' m not a fan of battle royal ' s ,  and this is yet another average one .  very predictable ,  even when you 1st see it ,  it ' s obvious l . o . d would win .  looking at sunny for 8 or so minutes though ,  definitely helps .   < br  /  >  < br  /  > 2 / 5 < br  /  >  < br  /  > wwf light heavyweight championship < br  /  >  < br  /  > taka michinoku | c |  vs aguila .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > taka gets a surprising pop ,  with his entrance .  fast ,  high - flying ,  and very exciting .  if these two had more time ,  they would have surely tore the roof off ,  with their stuff .  taka wins with the michinoku driver .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > 3 1 / 2  / 5 < br  /  >  < br  /  > wwf european championship .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > triple h | c |  vs owen hart stipulation here ,  is chyna is handcuffed to slaughter .  nice pop for owen ,  mixed reaction for trips .  a really ,  really underrated match ,  that ranks among one of my favorites for wrestlemania ,  actually .  the two mixed together very well ,  and owen can go with anybody .  trips wins ,  with chyna interference .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > 4 / 5 < br  /  >  < br  /  > mixed tag match .  marc mero & sable vs goldust & luna .  defining pop for sable ,  unheard of that time ,  for woman .  sable actually looks hot ,  and the crowd is just eating her up !  .  constant sable chants ,  and them erupting almost every time she gets in the ring .  not bad for a mixed tag match ,  it had entertaining antics ,  and passed the time well .  sable ' s team wins ,  when sable hits the tko .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > 2 1 / 2  / 5 < br  /  >  < br  /  > wwf intercontinental championship .  ken shamrock vs the rock | c |  .  before i review the match ,  i ' d like to note the rock showed off his immense potential ,  with his interview with jennifer flowers ,  before his match .  nice pop for shamrock ,  big time heat for the rock .  too disappointingly short ,  and i thought the ending was kinda stupid ,  though shamrock ' s snapping antics were awesome to see ,  and the crowd went nuts for it .  rock keeps the title ,  when the ref reverses the decision .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > 2 / 5 < br  /  >  < br  /  > dumpster match ,  for the wwf tag team championship < br  /  >  < br  /  > catcus jack & terry funk vs the new age outlaws .  the outlaws are not as over ,  as they were gonna be at this time .  crowd is actually somewhat dead for this ,  but i thought it had some great hardcore bits ,  with some sick looking bumps .  cactus and terry win the titles in the end .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > 3 / 5 < br  /  >  < br  /  > the undertaker vs kane .  big time ovation ,  for the undertaker .  much better than there outing at wrestlemania 20 ,  and for a big man vs big man match ,  this was really good .  it was a great all out brawl ,  with the undertaker taking a sick looking bump ,  through the table .  wwe was smart ,  by making kane looking strong ,  even through defeat .  after 2 tombstone kick out ' s ,  taker finally puts him away ,  with a 3rd one .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > 3 1 / 2  / 5 < br  /  >  < br  /  > wwf championship .   < br  /  >  < br  /  > special guest enforcer  " mike tyson "  < br  /  >  < br  /  > hbk | c |  vs steve austin .  big heat for tyson .  crowd goes ape sh * t for austin ,  definitely one of the biggest pops i have heard .  mixed reaction ,  for hbk .  this is truly a special match up ,  one of the greatest wrestlemania main events in history ,  you can tell when j . r is even out of breath .  hbk gives it his all ,  in what was supposed to be his last match ,  and austin has rarely been better .  the animosity and electricity from the crowd is amazing ,  and it ' s as exciting as it gets .  austin wins with the stunner ,  with tyson joining 3 : 16 by knocking out michaels .  austin ' s celebratory victory ,  is a wonder to behold ,  with one of the nosiest crowd ' s you will ever see ,  king said it right ,  they were going nuts .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > 5 / 5 < br  /  >  < br  /  > bottom line .  wrestlemania 14 is one of the greatest for real .  it has everything you want in a wrestlemania ,  and truly kick started the attitude era .  this is very special to me ,  because it was the 1st wrestlemania i ever saw ,  back in 98 .
