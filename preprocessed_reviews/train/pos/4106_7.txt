this definitely is not the intellectual film with profound mission ,  so i really don ' t think there is too much not to understand to in case you aren ' t czech .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > it ' s just a comedy .  the humor is simple ,  pretty funny and sometimes ,  maybe ,  little morbid .  some actors and characters are very similar to samotári  ( 2000 )   ( jirí machácek ,  ivan trojan ,  vladimír dlouhý )  so the authors are .  but it doesn ' t matter ,  the genre is really different and these two films shouldn ' t be compared in this way .  jedna ruka netleská won ' t try to give you a lesson ,  it will try to make you laugh and there is some chance it will succeed .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > not bad film ,  not the ingenious one ,  but i enjoyed it .  some scenes are truly worth seeing .
