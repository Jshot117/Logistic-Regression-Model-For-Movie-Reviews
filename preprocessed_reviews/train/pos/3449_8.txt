" i realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animation .  "  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the cast choice is equally enigmatic .  kenji kawai  -  who also composed the superlative soundtrack  -  appears as a ravenous burger fanatic ,  while renowned studio ghibli producer toshio suzuki spends his screen time being murdered in bizarre fashion .  others include katsuya terada ,  who dabbled with oshii on blood :  the last vampire ,  and shinji higuchi  -  a special effects whiz who ' s worked on godzilla movies .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > koichi yamadera ' s narration sounds like the stuff of a dry nhk documentary    which belies the comic undertone here as well as yamadera ' s extensive career voicing stoic anime characters like spike siegel in cowboy bebop .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > and the plot itself is a bizarre re - imagining of post - wwii japan in the context of various fast - food off - shoots  -  from soba ramen shops to gyudon stand - up bars ;  american dogs in the heat - up trays of convenience stores to mcdonalds -  inspired burger - chain restaurants .   " food is a primal root of desire ,  "  asserted oshii ,  by way of explanation .   < br  /  >  < br  /  > thrown into the mix is a new breed of consumer :  the fast - food grifters of the title ,  people who don ' t like to pay for their tucker and are constantly fine - tuning their elaborate scams to score free munchies .   < br  /  >  < br  /  > oshii said his ulterior motive was homage to the  " art "  of eating food on the streets    something still considered a bit of a taboo in this country ,  and which goes some way toward explaining the use of  " tachigui "  in the title .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the director of live - action movies  ( avalon ,  stray dog )  as well as animation ,  oshii has often blurred the definition between the two mediums .  the celluloid result here is deposited somewhere in the grey area between both formats .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > at times the visual experiment here is as exhilarating as it can be irritating .  just don ' t ask what it ' s all really supposed to mean ;  oshii ' s films ,  which are equal parts cerebral and innovative ,  are often not particularly clear story - wise .  where oshii succeeds is via a liberal dose of black humor    here you ' ll find kentucky fried rat ,  death by hula - hoop ,  the world ' s fastest samurai burger chef    and in the movie ' s very nature of surrealism .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > this is a man who defers to the influence of filmmakers like godard and truffaut ,  and perhaps owes as much to andrei tarkovsky as he does david lynch .  so it shouldn ' t come as any surprise that at one stage a b - 52 bomber does a fly -  through in a yoshinoya look - alike franchise .  the 54 - year - old writer - director seemed to think this natural .   " the japan i depicted in the movie may not necessarily be faithful to reality ,  "  he suggested .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > of course .   -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  < br  /  >  < br  /  > by andrez bergen
