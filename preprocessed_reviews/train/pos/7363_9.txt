this is not a love song .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > my one word summary of this film would be  ` excellent '  .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > it probably won ' t appeal to the mass movie watching public  Â–  it ' s a < br  /  >  < br  /  > film that forces you to participate .  you observe ,  think ,  and question .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > comparisons could be made with deliverance  ( topic / theme )  and < br  /  >  < br  /  > perhaps with the blair witch project for overall filming style .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > however this film stands unique against both .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the cinematography effects  ( solarisation ,  freeze frame ,  blur etc )  < br  /  >  < br  /  > have been seen before but they are used most effectively in this < br  /  >  < br  /  > film to underpin the natural tension of the story .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > acting is raw ,  menacing and utterly believable .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the real theme of the film is about friendship ;  the title really gives < br  /  >  < br  /  > the game away .  it ' s probably not the kind of friendship that most of < br  /  >  < br  /  > us have experienced or indeed would want to .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > it is a love song .
