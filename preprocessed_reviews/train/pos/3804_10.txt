my 3 year old loved it .  i loved it ,  my wife loved it .  so 10 out of 10 from our family .  as for violence level ?  not really that violent ,  mostly of the slap stick variety .  nobody truly dies ,  no gore ,  no blood ,  no torture ,  so it certainly is appropriate for children ,  much more so than many saturday morning cartoons .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > this movie really takes the idea of cg movies where it should go .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > first of all beautiful graphics ,  textures wonderfully done ,  with true depth ,  not trying to be realistic ,  but forming an artistic whole .  the moss on the stones ,  the rust on metal ,  the reliefs on the wood and the stone ,  everything adds to the whole .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > character modeling ,  unlike many contemporary cg movies ,  is quirky ,  not cute ,  again within an artistic whole .  the faces may look less malleable than in some other movies ,  but the characters are more puppet - like than human - like .  i think that is a good thing ,  it lends veracity ,  how strangely it may sound ,  it is easier to suspend your disbelief .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > hair ,  fur ,  clothing ,  on par ,  at least with the likes of pixar .  just note in the opening scenes when lian - chu is fighting the giant slug ;  gwizdo is in front of some farmers ,  and all of them have detailed clothing which caused me to pause the movie just to admire it .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the setting .  far beyond the likes of cars ,  and even wall  e .  space has been done many times ,  but the fantasy environs of dragon hunters are only comparable with some scenes in never ending story and lord of the rings ,  but again it is an artistic whole ,  and with lots of good ideas thrown about effortlessly .  magnificent vistas like the scene in monsters inc .  where they ride all the doorways through its storage facility ,  or wall  e where we see the immense trash towers he made ,  abound in this movie ,  everything is grand ,  yet never dwelt upon ;  it is just the background the whole way !  the interlude where they walk through the area with the fantastic falls .  the chinese wall ,  the islands floating in the sky .  the broccoli in the sky ?  that is truly where i believe cg should go ,  make something which takes your breath away ,  and do it again and again .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the sound is good ,  the music is varied and not only epic ,  and thankfully without any vocals ,  and purely original for the movie .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > animation is quite good .  lending its inspiration to cartoons ,  especially some good use of stretch and squeeze .  sometimes not that realistic ,  but the 3d models are not realistic either .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > characterization is well done too .  lian - chu the gentle and uncertain giant is gradually growing in confidence basking in the attention of little zoé .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > gwizdo the wily manager of lian - chu redeems himself in the end ,  while zoé isn ' t really changed at all ,  but who wants that cute child to change anyway ?  i at least loved lian - chu more than any other recent character since sulley in monsters inc .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the internal strife in the group gets ironed out by the external pressures ,  just as it should in a proper fantasy story .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the story is mostly reminiscent of the never ending story ,  especially how the world brakes apart .  the monsters are pretty standard fare ,  except the flocking one .  it lacks the emotional impact of wall  e ,  which is the really strong point of that movie ,  but it is a much more fun ride ,  and lacks the annoying musical scene replaying in the former one ,  and has action from the first scene .  this movie is what you want to watch for a fun and exciting time .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the whole movie has ,  as i ' ve mentioned a whole vision ,  which seems to have been followed rigorously throughout .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > it seems ,  that the setting is ready for more adventures ,  and i for one would hope so .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > one side note ,  the french actor doing lian - chu sounded a bit like jean reno at first ,  but i ' m happy it wasn ' t him ,  though he is one of my favorites .  nice to hear a new ,  to me ,  voice .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > i give it a max rating ,  a bit surprised at the mediocre and low ratings by some ;  i have tried to address some of the concerns made by two of the reviews with the lowest vote .  approach this movie as an adventure ,  and as a european movie ,  not opposed to hollywood ,  but different .
