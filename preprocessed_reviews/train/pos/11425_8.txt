the story is about a little girl growing up in colonial africa ,  but it is so much more than that .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > anyone growing up in the south would experience the same things .  a longing for another ,  one of a different race ,  that cannot be consummated .  even a glance is forbidden .  there are no words needed .  their facial expressions say everything .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > it is the story of a black servant ,  protée  ( isaach de bankolé )  and a white woman ,  aimée  ( giulia boschi )  .  their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they cannot have each other .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the little girl ,  france  ( cécile ducasse )  is lonely and spends all her time with protée .  she really can ' t see this dance .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > one of the more irritating aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonials .  they cannot even get undressed for bed by themselves .  there world is about to end ;  they just don ' t know it yet .  their racist attitudes will be erased with their presence .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > i think i would like to visit this africa .  it seems so quiet ;  especially at night when you only hear the animals .
