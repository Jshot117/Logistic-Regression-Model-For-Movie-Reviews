ohhh man !  now this is what i ' m talking about !  as far as bad / cheesy horror flicks go this movie was truly in a class of its own .  a real gem !  < br  /  >  < br  /  > first off ,  the film wasn ' t originally in english .  that ' s okay because the voice dubbing was truly exceptional !  here is my favorite excerpt from the dialog  ( and there is plenty more where this came from )   " i ' m feeling a little better .  i ' m just thirsty for your blood !  "  < br  /  >  < br  /  > and what drama !  here is a play by play recap of the interaction between the military and scientists < br  /  >  < br  /  > scene 1 scientist :   " you can ' t do that it ' ll be a disaster !  "   -  -  military officer :   " that ' s just science fiction "   ( he then proceeds to cause a complete disaster just like the scientist predicted )  .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > scene 2 scientist :   " if you do that many people will die !  !  !  "   -  -  military officer :   " you don ' t know what you ' re talking about .  "   ( he does it and many people die )  .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > scene 3 scientist :   " don ' t do that it ' ll kill everyone !  "   -  -  military officer :   " that ' s nonsense "   ( he then proceeds to kill everyone )  < br  /  >  < br  /  > scene 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7  ( you get the idea )  .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > if that wasn ' t enough there were a few scenes that really stood out as instant classics !  in one scene ,  the military has literally 10 guys pointing guns at two unarmed men .  the leader yells ,   " go get  ' em !  "  and all 10 army guys ,  one at a time ,  drop their guns and fist fight the two adversaries !  instant classic !  < br  /  >  < br  /  > and don ' t worry .  no attention to detail was left out !  this movie even had a hip / upbeat  ' 80 ' s keyboard / synth soundtrack to set the mood !  < br  /  >  < br  /  > and trust me i realize this review might contain some spoilers ,  but there are so many goodies in this epic i really only scratched the surface .  a movie of this caliber only comes out once a decade !  a true movie watching experience !  a masterpiece !  wow !
