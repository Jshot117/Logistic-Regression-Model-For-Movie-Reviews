 ( honestly ,  barbra ,  i know it ' s you who ' s klicking all those  " no " s on my review .  22 times ?  ?  how many people did you have to instruct to help you out here ?  don ' t you have anything better to do ,  like look at yourself in the mirror all day ?  )  < br  /  >  < br  /  > steven spielberg told barbra that this was  " the best movie i ' ve seen since  ' citizen kane '  "  .  that pretty much says it all  -  and serves as a dire warning !  < br  /  >  < br  /  > what are the ingredients for a sure - fire cinematic disaster ,  and one that will haunt you ,  never letting you forget the tears of both laughter and pain ?  the ingredients :  barbra streisand ' s face ,  a musical ,  feminism ,  barbra streisand ' s voice ,  barbra streisand directing ,  and an ultra - corny / idiotic premise .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > hollywood is full of egomaniacs ,  this much we know .  in fact ,  nearly everyone    by definition    has to be an egomaniac in hollywood .  why would anyone want to act ?  for the  " art "  ?  !  ?  well ,  if you ' re dumb enough to believe what they tell you in their carefully prepared interviews and streisand has the biggest ego of them all !  this is quite an achievement .  to be surrounded by narcissistic cretins ,  and yet to manage to top them all    remarkable .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the movie ,  like all her  " solo "  endeavors ,  is an ego trip straight out of hell .  every scene streisand is in is automatically ruined .  stillborn .  but as it that weren ' t enough ,  she sings a whole bunch of streisandy songs    you know ,  the kind that enabled the mariah careys ,  the celine dions ,  and the whitney hustons of this world to poison our precious air - waves for decades now .  just for that she deserves not one but 100 south park episodes mocking her .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the premise ,  streisand dressing up as a man to study to become a rabbi ,  sounds like a zany zaz comedy .  apart from it being a cliché ,  the obvious problem is that streisand doesn ' t look like a woman nor does she look like a man    in fact i ' m not even sure she ' s human .  the way she looks in this movie ,  well it cannot be described in words .  e . t .  looks like a high - school jock by comparison .  she looks more alien than michael jackson in the year 2015 .  she looks horrible .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the songs .  they made me shiver .  particularly  " papa can you hear me squeel like a demented female walrus in heat ?  "  and  " tomorrow night i ' ll prepare the sequel ,  yentl 2 :  the return of the bitch "  .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > did you know that streisand considered having a nose - job early on in her career ,  but changed her mind when they told her her voice might change ?  can you believe that ?  she should have done it !  killing two flies with one swipe ,  that ' s what it would have been .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > if you ' re interested in reading my biographies of barbra streisand and other hollywood intellectuals ,  contact me by e - mail .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > should barbra streisand finally go into retirement ?  click  " yes "  or  " no "  .
