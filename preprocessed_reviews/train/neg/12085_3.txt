there ' s really not much need to begin this little review with a plot synopsis .  i mean it ' s shakespeare ' s hamlet for goodness sake    probably one of the best known plays ever written .  i ' m not embarrassed to admit that i came to this version of hamlet the way most people on imdb have    through mystery science theater 3000 .  while the show may not be the best venue to use to judge a movie ,  in this case i cannot imagine attempting to watch it without the comedic quips .  in a word ,  this german ,  made - for - tv version of hamlet is dreary .  152 minutes ?  no way !  it ' s too dark and depressing to be anything i want to spend almost three hours on .  i ' ve said it any number of times ,  but entertainment is the thing for me .  and this wrist - slitter is far from entertaining .  i will ,  however ,  give it a couple of points for what i felt was some reasonably good acting .  a 3 / 10 sounds about right to me .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > as much as i enjoy mst3k ,  their comments don ' t help to make hamlet any more palatable .  there are a few good riffs here and there ,  but overall ,  hamlet is just the wrong movie for mst3k .  shakespeare is far too talky to allow the comedy to have any sort of rhythm or flow .  as much as it pains me ,  i ' ve got to give hamlet a 1 / 5 on my mst3k rating scale .
