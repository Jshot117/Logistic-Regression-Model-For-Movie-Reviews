 ' succubus '  ,  the edited version of  ' necronomicon geträumte sünden '  ,  is a struggle to sit through ,  even at a lean 76 minutes ;  any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious euro horror tripe and i may have slipped into a coma .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > jess franco once again delivers a truly awful piece of 60s trash that appears to have been made by a cast and crew out of of their heads on class a hallucinogenics ,  since not one second of this mess made any sense whatsoever .  apparently ,  this is one of the better of his 180 +  films    it ' s hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the unfathomable plot deals with franco ' s usual themes of sex ,  violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of s & m for good measure ,  and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tedious .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > i may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy euro horror again    life is too short to be spent watching bilge like this .
