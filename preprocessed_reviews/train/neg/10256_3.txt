your mind will not be satisfied by this no  budget doomsday thriller ;  but ,  pray ,  who ' s will ?  a youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as church people .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > small _apocalyptically themed outing ,  end of the world has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style of the purely  ' 50s similar movies .  and it ' s not only that ,  but eotw plays like a hybrid  not only doomsday but convent creeps as well .  the villain of the movie is a well  known character actor .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > this wholly shameless slapdash seems a piece of convent  exploitation ,  that significantly  ' 70s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated .  anyway ,  the convent ' s secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco !  christopher lee is the pride of end of the world ;  but the end of the world is not at all his pride !
