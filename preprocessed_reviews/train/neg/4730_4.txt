when i was seventeen i genuinely believed elvis to be the king of rock and roll ,  and not only did i wish to see all 31 of his  " character "  movies ,  but it was my ambition to own them ,  too .  what an exceptionally poor excuse for a seventeen - year - old i must have been .  thankfully sense prevailed and live a little ,  love a little is the only elvis film i own .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the spotlight has fallen on this one recently since a remixed version of top song a little less conversation has been released as a single .   ( his first to reach the uk top ten in 22 years    his first uk no . 1 in 25 )  even when i was seventeen and in serious need of psychiatric help i realised that the songs for this movie weren ' t exactly first rate .  however ,  a little less conversation  -  rollnecks and 60s grooving aside  -  is a real standout .  finding a lesser - known song that only a relatively small few are aware of promoted into the mainstream produces a mixture of emotions .  it ' s nice to finally see faith in a song vindicated ,  but it ' s also saddening to see the disintegration of your own private cult .   ( and what chauvinistic lyrics ,  too .  though what other elvis song contains the word  " procrastinate "  ?  )  < br  /  >  < br  /  > but what really bothers me about this film is not a little less conversation but the 84 minutes that surround it .  actually based on a novel  ( kiss my firm but pliant lips  -  what kind of lame novel would that be ?  )  this one sees a bored elvis holed up with a  " comedy "  dog and a nympho .  within 90 seconds of meeting him ,  michele carey asks  " would you like to make love to me ?  "  quite a fast mover by any standards i ' m sure you ' ll agree .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > i do seem to recall that some of elvis ' s early movies  -  most notably jailhouse rock and king creole  -  weren ' t too bad ,  but this is just identikit hillbilly cobblers .  being fired from a newspaper job can lead to a five minute karate fight with a couple of gingernuts ,  causing a motorway pile up is good for a laugh ,  and models dress as pink mermaids .  there ' s even a dream sequence for god ' s sake .  maybe the only dumb stereotype it doesn ' t conform to is in not having all that many songs .  with just four to choose from ,  including the credits number ,  you ' re waiting an average of 22 minutes between tracks .  some movies would become vapid by having too many tunes ,  but here they might have helped to have numbed the pain .  of the remaining three tracks ,  then the edge of reality isn ' t actually that bad ,  though elvis ' s dance to it must surely have been called  " the bear trap "  .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > in one sense ,  for a pg certificate film from 1968 then this is shockingly high on sexual content .  sadly ,  however ,  with talking dogs ,  middle america sitcom values and the stiffest dancing you ' ll ever see ,  elvis ' s dignity is obliterated by this movie .
