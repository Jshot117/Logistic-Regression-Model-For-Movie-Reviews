this film comes as the ultimate disappointment in tsai ming - liang for me .  it oozes laziness from its every frame .  so i ' m not going to analyse it thoroughly either .  but some observations :  < br  /  >  < br  /  > 1 .  if the premise is drought ,  why we get to see city landscapes with blooming green trees ?  i wonder if that was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the film  ( in which thirst notifies the craving for intimacy ,  and watermelon the trivial substitute ,  sex )  .  or it is only a matter of lousy film - making ,  not giving a damn about being coherent .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > 2 .  we don ' t get to know what had happened to the porn actress ,  why she is unconscious or ,  presumably ,  dead .  it seems a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully  (  = bombastically )  delivered ,  but in retrospect ,  her inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick ,  a pretext    just as gratuitous and exploitative as the activity it is employed in .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > 3 .  nothing is expressed in this movie that antonioni hadn ' t expressed better 40 years ago    and without needlessly humiliating his actors .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > 4 .  the musical numbers  ( recycled from  ' the hole '  )  felt like a secondary - schooler ' s idea of artistic counterpointing ,  executed on that very secondary - school level of skill .  if that was the point ,  the point sucked .
