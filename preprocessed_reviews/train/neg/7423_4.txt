there ' s really not a lot to say about las vegas lady .  it ' s harmless enough ,  but it is little more than a dull heist film from the 70s .  the movie is neither as clever nor as sexy as it strives to be .  the plot is a retread of the tired old casino robbery storyline that ' s been done to death .  except in the case of las vegas lady ,  i think the robbery plot was designed by a 3 year - old .  the plan involves three women    one to unnecessarily and in plain view scale the outside of the circus cicus building ,  one to pose as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity ,  and one to stand around exposing her cleavage .  that ' s pretty much it .  intricate ,  huh ?  other than stella stevens and her aforementioned breasts ,  the other women involved in the plot aren ' t particularly memorable .  las vegas lady co - stars stuart whitman .  when not pawing stevens ,  his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most idiotic gun fights ever put on film .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > i really wanted to like this movie .  it does have that 70s feel to it that i always enjoy and some nice shots of las vegas circa 1975 .  but the movie itself is too dull to rate any higher than a 4 / 10    and that ' s probably overstating it .  in the end ,  las vegas lady is a waste of some perfectly good cleavage .
