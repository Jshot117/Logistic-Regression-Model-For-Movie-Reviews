( next to the grave of the soldier he sort off murdered )  the soldier wakes up from his grave in the form of zombie and kill them for taking revenge on his behalf .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the twist ending were so lame .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > even if you like b horror movies ,  don ' t watch this movie
