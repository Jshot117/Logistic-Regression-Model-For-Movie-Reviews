is there a book titled  " how to make a movie with every  ' man vs .  nature '  cliché imaginable "  ?  if not ,  ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects .  ants doesn ' t have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime .  i suppose the most surprising thing about ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes .  the set - up ,  the characters ,  the various sub - plots ,  the death scenes ,  and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times    and in most cases ,  much better .  it ' s amazing that so many of these insects on a rampage films were made in the 70s because they ' re all basically the same movie .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > and can someone please tell me what in god ' s name myrna loy is doing in this monkey - turd of a movie ?  a woman as talented and classy as loy deserved better than ants as one of her final movies .
