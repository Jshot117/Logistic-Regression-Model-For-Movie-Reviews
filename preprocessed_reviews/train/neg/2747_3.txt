i knew it would be ,  but i gave it a rent for some laughs and maybe some mindless fun .  anyone whose read a few of my reviews can see that i ' m pretty easy to please .  i really didn ' t think i ' d end up feeling this negatively towards it .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the plot is about an ancient army of dragons lead by a huge serpent that will destroy the world unless some chosen heroes who inherited the responsibility can become one with a good dragon or something i don ' t know .  it was so stupid ,  i didn ' t bother to put much effort into retaining it .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > it features a really dumb story full of ridiculous moments and goofy concepts .  so many of the events just felt totally random and sudden .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > i assume there was studio interference or something because the biggest problem i have with the movie is the fact that the story seems like it ' s trying to be so grand and epic ,  yet everything happens so fast and goes by so quickly .  i feel like i ' ve just been hit with a million plot points and action sequences in one big ball .  the film is like a punch in the face .  it doesn ' t take much time at all to establish characters or drama .  imagine the  " lord of the rings "  trilogy in 90 minutes you could have most of the epic battle sequences ,  but there would be absolutely no buildup and you ' d hardly care about the outcome of those battles .  that was the case with dragon wars 90 minutes of me not giving a crap ,  waiting for it to be over .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > fantastic cgi with some okay directing ,  but horrible acting ,  speedy pacing ,  and dumb story made this very hard to enjoy on any grounds .  i probably would have loved it when i was 6 .
