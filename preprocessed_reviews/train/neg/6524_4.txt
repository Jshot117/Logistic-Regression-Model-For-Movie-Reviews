the angry red planet  ( quickie review )   < br  /  >  < br  /  > like  " the man from planet x ,  "  this is a bizarre science fiction tale culled from an era where fantasy and science fiction were still damn near the same thing .  meaning ,  we have some highly laughable special effects and rampant pseudo - science masquerading as science fiction .  and yes ,  it ' s another  " classic "  released in a high quality transfer with a crisp picture and sharp sound -  - by midnite movies .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > so ,  the main reason to watch this film ?  oh ,  it ' s definitely the whole time our space crew is on mars .   ( what ,  you thought  " angry red planet "  referred to neptune ?  )  prior to that is some rather poor quality space crew boarding a space ship ,  inside of which they smoke and toss around sexist chauvinistic banter aimed at the  " puny female "  member of the crew .  it ' d be somewhat offensive by today ' s standards if it weren ' t so damn funny .  but mars is the real reason we ' re watching this thing .  the film is generally black and white ,  but mars ,  well mars is screaming bloody red .  it ' s filmed in this bizarre red plasticy sheen giving the angry red planet quite an interesting look of overexposed redness .  it ' s really quite a sight Â— as are the  ( ha ha )  aliens viewers are to witness .  the best being the  " ratbatspidercrab .  "  you think that ' s a joke ?  that ' s what they call it in the movie !  it ' s a gigantic chimera  ( small puppet )  of a thing combining traits of rats ,  bats ,  spiders ,  and crabs .  it bounds along all puppety and scares the sh * t out of our  " heroic crew .  "  there are other weird ,  and poorly imagined ,  aliens to be seen ,  but that one takes the cake .  eventually ,  after their harrowing experience on mars ,  the sexist crew boards their  " ship "  and returns to whatever planet it was they came from .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > this ain ' t for everyone .  science fiction film buffs  &  curiosity seekers ,  and some general film buffs .  fans of mystery science theater 3000 will have a field day with this one  ( if they never got to it on the show )  .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > 2 / 10 modern score ,  6 / 10 nostalgia score ,  4 / 10 overall .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  ( www . residenthazard . com )
