amazing .  that ' s what you ' d say if you sat through this film .  simply ,  incredibly ,  amazing .  it ' s actually so amazing that anyone was stupid enough to dump money into making this monstrosity that you simply can ' t believe what you ' re seeing .  that ,  my friends ,  is what is truly scary about this film .  somebody thought it was a good idea to make it .   < br  /  >  < br  /  > well ,  here ' s another amazingly original story :  high school student  ( occasionally seemed like college  go figure )  has whore for a mom ,  lives in a trailer park ,  and is an  " artist "  who is ridiculed for his  " being all different .  "  well ,  of course ,  this poor ridiculed boy is eventually killed and ,  here ' s the original part ,  his soul inhabits a scarecrow  ( beneath which ,  he is killed by his slutty mama ' s latest john )  .  then he goes around with the standard killing off of all the people that done hurt him .  awww .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > here ' s the breakdown :  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the good :  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - amazingly funny movie  even if that ' s not what the clearly drunk filmmakers wanted .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - this and the sequel on one disk in the wal - mart  $ 5 . 00 bin  so it ' s only a little overpriced .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > didn ' t hurt it ,  didn ' t help :  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - the violence and gore are kind of sub - standard .  one person is stabbed with a corncob .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - sounds like they put some effort into the music  but it doesn ' t really fit the movie  and isn ' t all that good .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the bad :  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - terrible ,  terrible acting .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - another slasher let - down with sexy women  none of them removing clothing .  when did that cease being a staple of low - brow slashers ?  ?  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - ridiculous story .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - the scarecrow vomits up one - liners that would make freddy krueger and arnold swartzenegger blush .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - standard underlying love story goes nowhere ,  and is poorly done .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - some of the people killed seem like they were chosen at random  you never really know who anybody is and then they ' re killed .  and you only assume that they must ' ve had it coming .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the ugly :  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - extremely average slasher fare ,  just with a murdering scarecrow instead of well ,  all that other crap .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - nowhere near as interesting as freddy krueger ,  jason voorhees ,  pinhead ,  chucky ,  or even angela from the  " sleepaway camp "  series  all of which are better than this atrocity .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - the absolute worst dialogue i have ever heard in my life .  the script is laden with a level of retardedness that i never imagined could exist .  i ' m serious here  it ' s a full step beyond terrible .  don ' t get me wrong ,  though ,  it ' s funny as hell  but i ' ve never heard more asinine banter  even in  " slumber party massacre iii .  "  this film makes  " jason x "  look like shakespeare .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - the man who kills the boy that becomes the scarecrow :  worst wig ever .  dialogue to match .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > memorable scene :  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  -  - the one where elementary - school youths spew out their own witty dialogue :   " hey ,  let ' s go find small animals to torture .  huh huh .  "  < br  /  >  < br  /  > acting :  3 / 10 story :  3 / 10 atmosphere :  2 / 10 cinematography :  1 / 10 character development :  2 / 10 special effects / make - up :  5 / 10 nudity / sexuality :  1 / 10  ( no nudity ,  mom ' s a whore ,  girls wear no bras )  violence / gore :  5 / 10  ( low quality ,  mediocre amount )  dialogue :  0 / 10  ( extremely ridiculous ,  blatant ,  over - the - top and painfully funny  so bad it ' s good .  my first rating for dialogue in any film !  )  music :  5 / 10 direction :  2 / 10 < br  /  >  < br  /  > cheesiness :  10 / 10 crappiness :  9 / 10 < br  /  >  < br  /  > overall :  3 / 10 < br  /  >  < br  /  > another one for just people like me who enjoy watching pure crap .  or slasher - film completists .  this is not a good movie ,  at all .  laughable dialogue and characters keep it from being truly boring .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > www . residenthazard . com
