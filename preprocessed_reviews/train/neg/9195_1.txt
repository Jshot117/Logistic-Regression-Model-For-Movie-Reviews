laid up and drugged out ,  as a kidney stone wended its merry way through my scarred urinary tract ,  with absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkillers swoon me into semi - oblivion ,  i happened to catch this movie on cable .  i wouldn ' t want anyone to think that i paid to view it in a cinema ,  or rented it ,  or    heaven forfend !     that i watched it straight .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > having played this sensationally gruesome video game and avidly trod the doomed rooms and dread passageways of the house ,  battling chariot  ( type 27 )  ,  the hanged man  ( type 041 )  ,  and other impossible sentinels ,  my curiosity was piqued as to how the game would transfer to the movie screen .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > it doesn ' t .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the banal plot revolves around a group of  " crazy kids "     a la scooby doo    attending a remote island for a world - shaking  " rave "     whatever that is .   ( you kids today with your hula - hoops and your mini - skirts and your pat boone )  after bribing a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there  ( a stupidity which begs its own network of rhetoric )  ,  they find the  " rave "  deserted .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > passing mention is made of a  " house "     presumably the titular house of the dead    but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locales divorced from any semblance of haunted residence .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > a fallen video camera acts as flashback filler ,  showing the island in the throes of a    party ?  !  is that it ?  oh ,  so this  " rave "  thingy is just a  " party "  ?  in the grand tradition of re - euphemizing  " used cars "  as  " pre - owned "  ,  or  " shell shock "  as  " post - traumatic stress disorder "  ,  the word  " party "  is now too square for you drug - addled ,  silicone - implanted ,  metrosexual jagoffs ?   < br  /  >  < br  /  > it is learned that the party was broken up by rampaging zombies .  intelligent thought stops here < br  /  >  < br  /  > i don ' t think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the mythos behind zombie re - animation .  zombies can ' t die    they ' re already un - dead .  they do not bleed ,  they know no pain .  unless their bodies are completely annihilated ,  they will continue being animated .  at least ,  that ' s what my jamaican witch priestess tells me .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > which means that a  . 45 shot into their  " hearts "  is not going to stop them ,  nor will a machete to the torso .  and a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly not bring forth gouts of blood .  at least in the video game ' s logic ,  the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated ,  leaving a fetid mush that cannot re - animate itself .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > yet each actor - slash - model gets their matrix - circular - camera moment ,  slaying zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum .  seriously ,  these zombies are more ineffective than the stormtroopers from  " return of the jedi "  ,  who get knocked out when ewoks trip them .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > i suppose the film ' s writer ,  mark altman ,  having penned the not - too - shabby  " free enterprise "  ,  felt compelled to insert a captain kirk reference ,  in the character of jurgen prochnow ,  who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dung - swill .  there is also a reference to prochnow ' s primo role in the magnificent  " das boot "  ,  when one of the untrained b - actors mentions that he  " looks like a u - boat captain "  .   "  .  i wonder how many of this movie ' s target audience of square - eyed swine picked up on any of the snide references to other films ,  as when prochnow declares ,   " say hello to my little friend "  ,  presaging his machine gun moment .   < br  /  >  < br  /  > aimed at a demographic who have not the wherewithal to comprehend the sisyphean futility of the video - game concept  ( i . e .  the game ends when you die    you cannot win )  ,  this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart .  accordingly ,  everyone dies in due course ,  except for a heterosexual pair of attractive white people .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > a better use for this film ' s scant yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through acting school ,  although ona grauer ' s left breast did a good job ,  as did her right breast    and those slomo running scenes :  priceless !  i especially liked the final scene with ona trying to act like she ' s been stabbed ,  but looking like she ' s just eaten ice cream too fast .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > attempting to do something more constructive with my time ,  i pulled out my digitally - restored ,  35th anniversary ,  special edition ,  widescreen anamorphic dvd of  " manos :  the hands of fate .  "  ah ,  yes !     the drugs were suitably brain - numbing  -  now here was some quality film - making < br  /  >  < br  /  >  ( movie maniacs ,  visit :  www . poffysmoviemania . com )
