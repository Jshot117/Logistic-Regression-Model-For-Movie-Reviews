there are so many goofy things about this movie that i can ' t possibly name but a few :  < br  /  >  < br  /  > bogart ' s character :  1 .  his name    whip mccord  ( too easy ,  so i ' ll leave it at that .  boy ,  it makes  ` humphrey '  sound good .  )  2 .  his long ,  curly hair and silly sideburns .  3 .  his black bart get - up ,  complete with spurs !  4 .  not sure what shade of lipgloss they ' ve got him wearing ,  but it ain ' t none too flattering .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > cagney ' s character  ( jim kincaid  )  :  1 .  his lipstick doesn ' t do him any favors ,  either .  2 .  the man is being swallowed by his hat during the entire film !  could they not find a hat to fit him ?  even a little ?  !  !  ?  !  3 .  his pants are too tight in the rear .  4 .  he blows the smoke off his gun one too many times ,  if you know what i mean ,  and i think you do .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > if you are a casual bogart or cagney fan ,  and figure it might be a change of pace to see them in a western ,  do yourself a favor and forget that thought .  even the horses look embarrassed !   ( that is ,  when they don ' t look bored .  )  < br  /  >  < br  /  > in all fairness ,  i admit that westerns are my least favorite film genre ,  but i ' ve still seen much ,  much better than this .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > on a comedy level ,  or as high camp ,  the oklahoma kid works .  otherwise ,  it ' s viewer beware .  therefore ,  see this only if a )  you must see every western out there b )  you are a true cagney or bogie completist c )  any of the above comments appeal to you .  woah .  .
