my god ,  what an incredible movie it is !  reminded me so much of the similar scene in mel gibson ' s movie  " we were soldiers "  when  " the company is not lost ,  they ' re just cut off "  and the other scene in pearl harbour when the british officer says to ben affleck  " if all americans are like you ,  then god help the nation that goes to war with america !  < br  /  >  < br  /  > put all 3 movies together and you would have enough bullshit to fertilise the entire sahara desert .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the story of the cut - off battalion may be real enough but the movie could have done without all that american preachy jingoistic propaganda attached to it .  there were audible groans in the cinema during the above - mentioned scene in pearl harbour  ( no kidding either )  the lost battalion however is really in a class of its own  .  < br  /  >  < br  /  >  " americans think they are unbeatableinspired bravery .   "  i actually cringed and damn near puked at all the swill being spewed out throughout this diarrhoeic disaster  ( the movie that is )   < br  /  >  < br  /  > the fighting scenes were well made  ( 3 stars for that )  but if the script is manure ,  then wrapped even in brightly coloured ribbons ,  it is still manure .  the writer ,  james carabatsos ,  also wrote those other screamershamburger hill ,  no mercy  ,  heartbreak ridge .  someone ,  please shoot him before he writes any more such garbage .  < br  /  >  < br  /  > the director ,  russell mulcahy is an australian too .  god ,  the shame !  !  !
