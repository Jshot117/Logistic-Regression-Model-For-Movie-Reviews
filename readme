This is a logistic regression model that predicts whether a movie review is either positive or negative

In order to begin you would need to preproccess the data

Then to run the pre-process.py you need to run four lines of commands 

python pre-process.py movie-review-HW2/aclImdb/train/pos preprocessed_reviews/train/pos
python pre-process.py movie-review-HW2/aclImdb/train/neg preprocessed_reviews/train/neg
python pre-process.py movie-review-HW2/aclImdb/test/pos preprocessed_reviews/test/pos
python pre-process.py movie-review-HW2/aclImdb/test/neg preprocessed_reviews/test/neg

After the data is proccessed you would need to run LR.py(will take a couple of minutes)

The Logistic regression model will output its accuracy for correctly predicting the movie revies as either positive or negative
It will then report the probabilites for each positive and negative class
It will then report the accuracy for the small test data
It will then report the probabilites for each positive and negative class for the small data
